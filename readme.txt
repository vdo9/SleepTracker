6. Did you design your app with a particular type of user in mind? If so, whom?
My app is designed for a student user who prefers a simple interface design. 

7. Did you design your app specifically for iOS or Android, or both?
It is designed specifically for iOS.


8. How can a person log overnight sleep in your app? Why did you choose to support logging overnight sleep in this way?
They can log overnight sleep through the overnight tab of the app. By separating the view of the overnight log from the home page and day log page, it makes visualizing the app easier.


9. How can a person log sleepiness during the day in your app? Why did you choose to support logging sleepiness in this way?
The user can log sleepiness during the day in the day tab. The ability to use a range tool for choosing the sleepiness rating is more convenient.


10. How can a person view the data they logged in your app? Why did you choose to support viewing logged data in this way?
The user can view the data logged in the app through the home tab. I decided to merge the data since the user will want to view their logs chronologically.


11. Which feature choose--using a native device resource, backing up logged data, or both?
I chose a native device resource (option 1). 


12. If you used a native device resource, what feature did you add? How does this feature change the app's experience for a user?
The user can turn on reminder notifications to receive push notifications reminding them to log their data. This will allow the user to come back to the application, reminding them to continue using the app.


13. If you backed up logged data, where does it back up to?
I used local notifications and local storage.

14. How does your app implement or follow principles of good mobile design?
My app is separated by three tabs and stores the information users need to interact with in cards. There is also a color scheme to make the information stand out more.
